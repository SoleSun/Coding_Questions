* find the median of two sorted arrays

* serialise and deserialise a linked list

* construct a binary tree fro given inorder and preorder traversals

* return a tree such that each internal node stores sum of all its child node. Each leaf node stores zero. 

* reverse a linked list in groups of K

* check whether a binary tree is balanced or not. i.e. no two leaves should have height difference of greater than one. 

* given a matrix of characters and a word, you have to count the number of occurrences of that word in that matrix. You can move to any of the eight valid directions from current position.

* normalize a path

* given a binary search tree, print hte path which has the sum equal to k and has minimum hops i.e. if there are multiple paths with the sum equal to k then print the path with minimum number of nodes

* rotate a matrix by 90 degrees

* implement a hashmap on your own. Write a good hashing function for string. 

* given an array which is first strictly increasing and then strictly decreasing, find an element in this array

*
