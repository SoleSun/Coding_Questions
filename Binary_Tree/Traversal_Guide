In-Order Traversal, as the name suggests, lists the elements of the trees and their IDs in ascending order.
It is useful for verifying a binary search tree, which is expected to have its smallest elements in the
leftmost leaf and its greatest element in the right most leaf. The logic is as follows:

    traverse left 
    visit root
    traverse right

Pre-Order Traversal is useful for copying BST. 
    visit root
    traverse left
    traverse right

Post-Order Traversal is used to delete the tree. The left and right traversals are interchangeable. All that
needs to happen is that the children be deleted before the parent. 
    traverse left
    traverse right
    visit root
    
In - Order Traversal is breadth-first search of a binary tree.
